    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you are using the Servlet Template in Eclipse, you may encounter the error saying “The import javax.servlet cannot be resolved.”</p><p>For example, I am using Eclipse for Mac (Version 4.19.0). First, create a Dynamic Web Project, target runtime: Apache Tomcat v10.0, Dynamic web module version 4.0. And inside this project, create a new servlet file using the Create Servlet Wizard. Soon you will see the errors pop up in the servlet file you just created.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// BEFORE</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> java.io.IOException;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.ServletException;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>How to fix it? All you have to do is changing the superclass name from javax into jakarta. Why does this happen? I think it is because, as mentioned on Wikipedia page, that from 12 Jun 2020 and on, API moved from package javax.servlet to jakarta.servlet. Let’s hope Eclipse will update the template someday in future. For the exising codes out there, I guess they are doing well.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// AFTER</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> java.io.IOException;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.ServletException;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Of course, you can create an empty class file to build servlet from scratch, to avoid such issues.

Anyway, put it in a simple way, the paradox is talking about the contradiction between the reality that we have not met any aliens and the high probability there should be so many aliens in the cosmos because the universe is so big.</p><p>It occurs to me that when a society becomes more civilized, it kind of loses the impulse to invade as one way of exploration. You need to treat all those living things equally because you can see the tendency that we treat with each other more fairly no matter who you are, where you come from, or what are you. In the end, everyone lives happily in their chambers and forgets the big universe exists.</p><p>Or maybe, there could be a pandemic out there in the universe, everyone during this period of time needs to stay low and keep quiet. It is equivalent to the dark forest theory I know. But the twist here is that the pandemic can end, and it will.</p>]]></content>

Thanks to the internet, we can have the learning experience with such a wonderful teacher David Malan.

So you have to wait.</p><p>After the pandemic, I think people will realize that most of the office work can be done anyway at home.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I was trying to use VLookup function in excel to find a particular item in one column with multiple criteria in other columns. It can be done with adding extra columns first to create one real column to look up for and attach the data column you are looking for after that artificial column. For example, you can combine column A&amp;B&amp;C to merge them into one column, so that you can use VLOOKUP(item_A&amp;item_B&amp;item_C, A&amp;B&amp;C&amp;data_column, 2, 0) to find the result.</p><p>To avoid making extra columns, in this case, A&amp;B&amp;C&amp;data_column, I found we can also use IF({1, 0}, A&amp;B&amp;C, data_column) to make such matrix instead of actually copying &amp; pasting to create one. Because IF function can work with array {1, 0} as logical tests, so basically it runs the first test with 1 (i.e. True) and then again with 0 (i.e False), in the end, it generates the result matrix A&amp;B&amp;C &amp; data_column. Really impressive because it looks simple and elegant.</p>]]></content>
