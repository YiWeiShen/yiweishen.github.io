    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously, I listened to the topic of remote working in one of the podcasts. It is something new to me if the work is entirely remote, but I would say to some extent, we need to get used to this concept of remote working with colleagues in a team. In the beginning, you might feel the pain that when you need to talk to someone to get things done, but other people are living in different time zones, which means they are still in their sleep. So you have to wait.</p><p>After the pandemic, I think people will realize that most of the office work can be done anyway at home. So finding a better way of collaboration among people in different places is one of the most important things to do. You can write more emails. Maybe.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I was trying to use VLookup function in excel to find a particular item in one column with multiple criteria in other columns. It can be done with adding extra columns first to create one real column to look up for and attach the data column you are looking for after that artificial column. For example, you can combine column A&amp;B&amp;C to merge them into one column, so that you can use VLOOKUP(item_A&amp;item_B&amp;item_C, A&amp;B&amp;C&amp;data_column, 2, 0) to find the result.</p><p>To avoid making extra columns, in this case, A&amp;B&amp;C&amp;data_column, I found we can also use IF({1, 0}, A&amp;B&amp;C, data_column) to make such matrix instead of actually copying &amp; pasting to create one. Because IF function can work with array {1, 0} as logical tests, so basically it runs the first test with 1 (i.e. True) and then again with 0 (i.e False), in the end, it generates the result matrix A&amp;B&amp;C &amp; data_column. Really impressive because it looks simple and elegant.</p>]]></content>

It did lead you somewhere in the end that you can put them together to build an entire computer. </p><p>What a great experience.
